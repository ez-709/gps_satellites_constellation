### Project Description

**GPS Satellites Constellation** is a visualization and simulation project that demonstrates the orbital mechanics and positioning of satellites in the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation. The project aims to provide an intuitive understanding of how GPS satellites orbit the Earth, their distribution in space, and how they enable accurate positioning and navigation on the planet's surface.

Using simplified models and visualizations, this project shows:
- The orbital paths of GPS satellites
- Satellite positions at any given time
- How the constellation maintains global coverage
- Basic principles of trilateration used in GPS calculations

This project is ideal for educational purposes, space enthusiasts, and developers interested in satellite technology and orbital mechanics.
